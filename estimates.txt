Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 10 minutes
==============================================
The setup uses multi-AZ configuration, so there's a standby instance in a different AZ.  There's no manual intervention necessary in this case.  According to AWS documentation, the switch only takes few minutes, so 10 minutes is more than enough for the recovery.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 30 minutes
==================================================
Manual intervention is necessary to promote the read replica.  Assuming there are people on the call, it will take them about 10-15 minutes to log in to AWS.  Another 5-10 minutes are necessary for the promotion to complete.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 5 minutes
=============================================
According to https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-rds-under-the-hood-single-az-instance-recovery/, the recovery is typically 5 minutes ((the interval required for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3)

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 5 minutes
=================================================
There's a lag between when the data is written to the master db and replica (replica lag).  The lag should only be few seconds, so RPO of 5 minutes should be sufficient.
